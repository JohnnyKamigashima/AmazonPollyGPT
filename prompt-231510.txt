When it comes to software development, the ultimate goal is to deliver a product that meets customer requirements, functions flawlessly, and provides a seamless user experience. Achieving this requires a well-structured testing process that includes various stages, one of which is the test case review.

Test case reviews play a vital role in validating the effectiveness and thoroughness of the test cases. In this blog, we’ll delve into the test case review process to ensure that your testing journey is a success. Let’s get started.

Why is Test Case Review Important?
Test cases are the basic units over which the complete testing process is executed. Having perfect test cases ensures perfect testing and high standards of quality in the application. Test case reviews help make them better as:

During the test case review — two viewpoints are incorporated, if anything is missed by one, that can be provided by the other.
Test case reviews ensures that all team members are on the same page about the feature and requirements
During test case reviews, any discrepancies in understanding the requirements can be sorted out sooner, when the costs of rectifying are less, rather than later, when the costs could be exponentially high.
Who Reviews the Test Cases?
The test case review process is done by the test lead or other test engineers in the team. After the author finishes creating test cases, they will be sent to the other test engineers, known as reviewers, for the test case review process. The reviewer verifies the correctness, accuracy, flow, and coverage of the test case.

What is Test Case Repository?
A test case repository is a centralized storage for all the test cases that the test lead or test manager authored, reviewed, and authorized. It includes test cases that contain all the key possibilities of workflow execution, thus ensuring all variations in the application and test scenarios are covered.

Benefits of Test Case Repository
Imagine that every QA member maintains their own document for test cases. This will only lead to confusion when you work as a team, and there is a high chance of losing track of the test plan and execution. If you don’t maintain a proper test case repository, then it might lead to missed execution of test cases, patchy test coverage, and, eventually, poor product quality. That is why maintaining a test case repository is highly important for medium to large projects.

Besides, testing is a repeatable procedure. Reusing test cases is one of the major advantages, as it helps save time. In large projects, frequent testing will be required. And, when you have a test case repository, it will let you reuse your previous test resources wherever required and accelerate the testing process. Also, maintaining a test repository is quite easy!

Here are some of the top benefits of a test case repository:

All the authorized test cases will be stored in a test case repository.
QA team will always have a complete backup of the test case repository in case of a crash that might affect the application.
It can be easily updated whenever required.
It helps save time.
Testers’ test case creation skills can be assessed on a performance basis.
It helps achieve comprehensive test coverage.
It helps with test reports.
The status of test cases can be easily displayed via a chart with values like pass, fail, or not tested.
Boosts application quality and knowledge.
