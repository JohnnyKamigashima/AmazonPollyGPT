Test Creation
To Achieve Efficient Web Development Testing, We Can Leverage The Power Of An Automated Test Framework Like Selenium. By Enabling A Test Framework, We Can Accurately Locate Specific Elements On A Webpage And Execute Actions Such As Clicking, Moving The Mouse Pointer, Or Verifying The Existence Of Certain Elements. To Fully Control These Processes, A Comprehensive Test Script Must Be Coded And Implemented To Thoroughly Test The Application's Functionality.

As An Engineer, Creating A New Script Is A Meticulous And Iterative Process That Involves Multiple Rounds Of Testing And Debugging. Even A Simple Script Can Take Several Hours To Develop, And When Cross-Browser Testing Is Required, The Process Can Extend To Several Days. This Is Why Only A Handful Of Companies Can Automate More Than A Small Portion Of Their Test Cases. To Create A Successful Test Script, Going Through Each Step Carefully And Methodically Is Essential. It Is Regular Software Programming.

How AI Improves The Process
Performing The Test Manually Takes Hours, But Using The Underlying System Automates It And Reduces The Time To Just Minutes. As You Run The Test, The System Builds ML Models Of How Your Site Operates And Records Vast Amounts Of Data. It Can Learn What Buttons Are Being Pressed And Why With Techniques Like NLP. Building A Model Is Crucial, Ensuring The Test Works On Any Browser Or Device, Even With Dynamic Content And Third-Party Widgets Like PayPal's "Buy Now" Buttons Or HubSpot Forms.

Regarding Test Analysis, The Scripts Are Usually Simple Pass-Fail Checks. The Test Verifies Whether The Outcome Of An Action Matches The Expected Result.

Test Analysis
Ensuring That Your Tests Produce The Desired Outcome Requires Clear And Specific Instructions. Though The Concept Of Pass Or Fail Seems Straightforward, The Process Is Far From Simple.


To Maintain Reliability, A Test Should Only Indicate Failure In The Presence Of An Error Or Defect And Success When Everything Functions As Intended. Unfortunately, Traditional Test Automation Falls Short In Two Areas:

It Solely Tests What Is Explicitly Instructed, That Is, Test Automation Is A Helpful Tool For Testing Scripts, But It Only Tests What You Explicitly Tell It To. This Means That Large Portions Of Your User Interface May Go Untested Unless You Put In Significant Effort To Create Your Tests.
2. This Approach Needs More Room For Improvement, Which Means That Updates To Web Pages Or Mobile Screens, Redesigns, And Other Explicit Changes Can Significantly Impact The Reliability Of Test Scripts. This Can Cause The Test Code To Become Fragile And Susceptible To False Positives Due To Brittle Selectors. As A Result, Test Failures May Return Inaccurate Results.

In A Nutshell, If You're Facing Recurring Flakiness Issues In Your Automated Test Runs, You Cannot Be Confident That Your Tests Have Indeed Passed Or Failed. This Is Often The Case For Products With Automated Tests In Their CI Pipelines, Making It A Crucial Point To Consider.

How AI Improves Test Analysis
AI Can Improve Test Analysis In Three Important Ways.

First, You Can Use Computer Vision And Machine Learning To Increase The Scope Of The UI You Test. This Visual Testing Approach Can Compare Your Site's Current Appearance Against Previous Test Runs. If Something Unexpectedly Changes, It Can Be Flagged As A Potential Bug.
Second, The Tests Are More Reliable. False Positives Are Much Less Likely Because The Tests Are Robust To Changes In UI.
Third, The ML Model Is Constantly Learning How Your Site Should Perform. For Example, It Learns How Long Each Page Should Take To Load, And It Uses This To Set Up An Intelligent Wait Time Before The First Interaction With The Page. So If A Page Suddenly Takes Longer To Load, It Must Report This As A Test Failure.
Test Maintenance
Test Maintenance Is The Bane Of Every Test Engineer's Life. All The Tests Break When The UI Changes Or The Site Logic Is Updated. This Means You Waste Hours Fixing And Debugging Your Tests. This Is Euphemistically Called Test Maintenance.

Why Test Maintenance Exists
Test Maintenance Can Be A Hassle, But It Shouldn't Be Necessary In The First Place. The Reason For Test Maintenance Is Due To Selectors. Selectors Are Used To Instruct Test Automation Frameworks On Which Elements To Interact With. However, Selectors Can Change Whenever A Website Changes, No Matter How Carefully They Were Initially Chosen, And This Can Cause Scripts To Fail Immediately When The Selector Changes.

How AI Removes The Need For Routine Maintenance
AI And Machine Learning Models Can Employ A Self-Healing Mechanism That Detects Any Alterations Or Relocations Of Elements On The Page And Selects The Appropriate HTML Element Accordingly. This Ensures The Continued Functionality Of The Tests, Even If An Element Such As The "Sign In" Button Is Renamed To "Register" And Repositioned. AI Can Be Designed To Adapt To Changes Seamlessly And Maintain The Highest Accuracy And Reliability In Our Testing Process.

With The Help Of AI, You Can Also Perform Intelligent Test Editing. This Includes Updating A Test Step Directly From A Screenshot And Utilizing The ML Data Gathered During Each Test Run. Visual Testing Frameworks Like Applitools, Percy, And SmartUI Have Mastered This Feature, Revolutionizing How We Approach Editing Test Code.

We're Tackling Test Editing, Including Testing And Debugging. Occasionally, Changes Can Be Significant, Such As Removing A Button Or Altering Every Item In A Dropdown Menu. However, With An AI-Powered Software Testing Platform, Detecting Issues And Receiving SmartFix Suggestions Based On Millions Of Test Results Is Effortless.
